## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the principal use of arrays?
an array stores values under a single variable without having to declare every single value.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript.
const (declaring the variable) arrayName (the variable itself) is being assigned to an array (open and closing brackets) with the values stored in the array (numbers or strings)

- What number represents the **first** index of an array?
0

- How can you access the last element of an array?
[name of array].length - 1
using the .length property accesses the length of the array, and subtracting one accesses the last number (think of n - 1).
